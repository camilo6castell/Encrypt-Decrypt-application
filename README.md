## About

This application based on **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** encrypts a text entered by the user and returns content that is difficult to read. Likewise, it offers the option of deciphering a text that has been encrypted by this system, otherwise **it will return an error**.

_This exercise is carried out as part of the Alura Latam and Oracle One Next Education program._

## Keys used to encrypt

1. The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
2. The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
3. The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
4. The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
5. The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

## Extra functionality

My application offers the chance to copy the output to the clipboard!

To do so, you need to _click_ into the output box and done, an alert will show the success copy.
